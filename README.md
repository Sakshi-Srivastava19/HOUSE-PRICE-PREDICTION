## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a **House Price Prediction Model** using supervised Machine Learning techniques. The model predicts property prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, year built, and more. It demonstrates the complete ML workflow including **EDA, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit**.

## 📊 Sample Results
| Model                  | MAE      | RMSE     | R² Score |
|------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Linear Regression       | 20,500   | 28,700   | 0.85     |
| Random Forest Regressor | 16,200   | 24,000   | 0.89     |
| XGBoost Regressor       | 15,400   | 22,500   | 0.91     |

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Deploy the model on **Render / Heroku**.
- Integrate more advanced regression techniques (Stacking, Ensemble Blending).
- Add location-wise price filtering.
- Build an interactive web dashboard for dynamic inputs.
